# TODO List Project 

## Gettings Started

### Database Setup


Setup postgres db container
    $ make db-up



### Create Your Databases

Ok, so you've edited the "database.yml" file and started your database, now Buffalo can create the databases in that file for you:

	$ buffalo pop create -a

## Starting the Application

Buffalo ships with a command that will watch your application and automatically rebuild the Go binary and any assets for you. To do that run the "buffalo dev" command:

	$ buffalo dev

If you point your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) you should see a "Welcome to Buffalo!" page.

**Congratulations!** You now have your Buffalo application up and running.

## What Next?

We recommend you heading over to [http://gobuffalo.io](http://gobuffalo.io) and reviewing all of the great documentation there.

Good luck!
